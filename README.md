# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Repository

This repository contains C++ and Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each file addresses a specific category of DSA concepts, useful for learning, interviews, and practice.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. `arrays.cpp`
Contains implementations and operations related to arrays such as:
- Insertion and deletion
- Traversal
- Searching elements
- Array-based algorithms (e.g., max subarray sum, prefix sum, etc.)

### 2. `linkedlists.cpp`
Includes code for:
- Singly linked list operations (insert, delete, reverse, traverse)
- Possibly doubly linked list operations
- Handling edge cases (empty list, loop detection, etc.)

### 3. `searching.cpp`
Implements searching algorithms such as:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)
- Possibly includes variations like search in rotated array

### 4. `sorting.cpp`
Implements classic sorting algorithms, such as:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### 5. `stack.cpp`
Provides stack operations like:
- Push, Pop, Peek
- Stack using arrays or linked lists
- Additional stack problems like balanced parentheses, postfix evaluation

### 6. `tree.cpp`
Includes tree data structures and algorithms:
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
- Insertion, Deletion in BST
- Possibly recursive and iterative implementations

### 7. `visuzlization.py`
Python script likely used to visualize some of the above data structures or their operations. (e.g., animations or charts using matplotlib/graphviz)

### 8. `.vscode/`
Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.
- `c_cpp_properties.json`: Defines include paths and settings for IntelliSense.
- `settings.json`: Custom settings for the workspace.

## üí° Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NitinSharma077-echo/DSA.git
   ```
2. Compile and run any C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ arrays.cpp -o arrays
   ./arrays
   ```
3. For Python visualization:
   ```bash
   python visuzlization.py
   ```

## üß† Ideal For
- Beginners learning Data Structures & Algorithms.
- Interview preparation.
- Building strong fundamentals in C++ and Python.

## üìå Note
- Code is structured for readability and ease of understanding.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
- new codes will be added on regular bases
